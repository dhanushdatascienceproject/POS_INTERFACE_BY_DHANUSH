App Flow
Dashboard: After logging in, the user is presented with the dashboard, which contains navigation links to "Orders" and "Analytics" sections.

Orders: Clicking on "Orders" in the taskbar shows the orders section where users can view and manage orders. This view displays the total number of orders and their details.

Analytics: Clicking on "Analytics" in the taskbar shows the analytics section, displaying the total items sold and the total revenue.

Services List: In the "Available Services" section, users can select services/products and add them to the cart.

Customer Form: During checkout, users are prompted to enter customer details, including name, address, and contact information.

Checkout: The user can complete the purchase, which will update the sales data (total items sold and total revenue).

Key Functions
Add to Cart: Users can add services/products to the cart, which will be displayed in the "Cart" section.
Remove from Cart: Users can remove items from the cart.
Clear Cart: Option to clear all items from the cart.
Handle Checkout: When the checkout is completed, the sales data is updated with the number of items sold and the total amount.
Taskbar Navigation
The taskbar (sidebar) contains the following options:

Dashboard: The main page where users can navigate to other sections.
Orders: Manage orders placed by customers.
Analytics: View sales analytics, including total items sold and total services sold.
Settings: Placeholder for future settings options.
Profile/Logout: Links to the user profile and logout functionality.
Styling
The project uses custom CSS to style the components and maintain consistency across the application:

Taskbar: A fixed sidebar on the left side with a sleek, dark blue-gray background and white text. The buttons change color on hover to improve the user experience.
Buttons: Buttons are styled with a subtle hover effect to indicate interactivity.
Cards: Cards for services are styled with a border and padding for a clean, modern look.
Future Improvements
User Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization for secure access to the application.
Order History: Add a feature to view past orders.
Payment Integration: Integrate a payment gateway to handle actual payments during checkout.
Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure the app is fully responsive for mobile devices.
Conclusion
This project serves as a simple yet functional POS system with the ability to manage orders and track sales analytics. It's designed to be scalable, and additional features such as user authentication and payment integration can be added in future iterations.
